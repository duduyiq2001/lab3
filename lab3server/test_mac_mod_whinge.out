FIRST_WITCH.
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

SECOND_WITCH.
When the hurlyburly's done,
When the battle's lost and won.

THIRD_WITCH.
That will be ere the set of sun.

FIRST_WITCH.
Where the place?

SECOND_WITCH.
Upon the heath.

THIRD_WITCH.
There to meet with Macbeth.

Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
Hover through the fog and filthy air.

DUNCAN.
What bloody man is that? He can report,
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
The newest state.

MALCOLM.
This is the sergeant
Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought
'Gainst my captivity.--Hail, brave friend!
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it.

SOLDIER.
Doubtful it stood;
As two spent swimmers that do cling together
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald,--

LENNOX.
That seems to speak things strange.

ROSS.
God save the King!

DUNCAN.
Whence cam'st thou, worthy thane?

ROSS.
From Fife, great king;
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold.
Norway himself, with terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm,
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us.

DUNCAN.
Great happiness!

ROSS.
